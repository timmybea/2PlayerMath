Two Player Math Game
Create a 2-player guessing game where players take turns to answer simple addition problems. The math questions are automatically generated by the game. It should do this by picking two numbers between 1 and 20.

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they incorrectly answer a question. Scores will be displayed for every player and if a player gets a question wrong, the new score for that player will be shown.

The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives.

Please read all of the steps and tips prior to starting your game.

Step 1

Create a new Single View Application. We will be going over AutoLayout tomorrow! But for right now, go to the Storyboard and disable AutoLayout / Size Classes in the File Inspector (the first of the 6 tabs of the right that relate to the storyboard).

Step 2

Add a UILabel that displays “Player 1: X + Y?”. Where the first part is which player’s turn it is. And the second part is the addition problem they have to get correct or they will lose a life.

Step 3

Add 10 UIButtons, one for each number from 0 to 9. Add another UIButton for enter. The player will press the buttons that correspond to the sum of the question asked and then press the enter button.

Step 4

Add 2 UILabels on the top right. One for Player 1’s current score, and one for Player 2’s current score.

TIP: What’s the M - V - C look like?

Before starting on the code, consider how you will break down this into your models, views and view controllers.

You probably want a Player class, where you will put all of your Player-specific logic and properties. Your Player class should have an instance method for losing a life.

You probably also want a ‘GameModel’ class where you put everything that has to do with generating the game for both players.
